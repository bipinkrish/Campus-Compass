# Campus Compass

## Problem Statement

*
Develop an online navigation application, called Campass Compass, that provides real-time
updates and detours for users to efficiently reach their desired destination without relying on
map downloads. The application should utilize GPS technology and server information to
accurately guide users through unfamiliar locations. Additionally, the application should have
a user-friendly interface that allows for easy input of destination and preferences, and provide
clear and concise directions to users throughout their journey. The application should also
have the ability to update its route based on real-time traffic or other factors that may affect
travel time.
